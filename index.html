  <h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>An ambitious school leaver looking to get into the technology industry, this being evident through my overall good A level results I have achieved in 2017. Also, I have managed to complete several online courses on languages like HTML, CSS and
    JAVASCRIPT all by myself. I can also adapt to a fast-paced environment as seen through my work experience as a crew member at McDonald’s.</p>
